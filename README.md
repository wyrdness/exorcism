#### 1. Placebo Effect
Ritual provides psychological relief; expectation of cure creates improvement

#### 2. Social/Family Support
Attention and support from community provides comfort

#### 3. Natural Course of Illness
Some psychiatric conditions improve over time regardless of intervention

#### 4. Psychiatric Treatment More Effective
Actual psychiatric care addresses underlying conditions

**Psychiatric conditions require psychiatric treatment.** Exorcism may provide cultural/religious comfort but is **not a substitute for medical care**.
