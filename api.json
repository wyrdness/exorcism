      "summary": "Religious or spiritual practice to expel demons or spirits from possessed individuals, performed across multiple faith traditions including Catholic, Protestant, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish practices.",
      "full": "Exorcism is a religious or spiritual practice to expel demons, spirits, or other entities from individuals believed to be possessed. Major traditions include Catholic exorcism (Roman Ritual, authorized priest required), Protestant deliverance ministries, Islamic ruqya (Qur'an recitation), and Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish variations. The Catholic procedure involves an authorized priest, bishop permission, Rite of Exorcism with prayers, commands, holy water, and crucifix. Famous exorcists include Father Gabriele Amorth (Vatican exorcist claiming 60,000+ exorcisms). Famous cases include the Anneliese Michel tragedy (died during exorcism, 1976) and Roland Doe (1949). Modern Church position requires psychiatric evaluation first, considers genuine possession extremely rare, and takes cautious approach. Dangers include documented deaths (Anneliese Michel and others) and delayed psychiatric treatment. Scientific view: ritual may provide psychological relief through placebo effect, but psychiatric treatment is more effective. This is a sacred practice in multiple religions requiring cultural sensitivity."
